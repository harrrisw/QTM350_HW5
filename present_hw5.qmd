# Introduction

This presentation summarizes the analysis of three important economic indicators across various countries:
- **Inflation Rate**
- **GDP Growth Rate**
- **Life Expectancy**

The data comes from the World Development Indicators (WDI) dataset, published by the World Bank.


# Exploratory Analysis

## Inflation Rate Distribution

- The histogram shows the distribution of inflation rates across different countries.
- Most countries have low inflation rates, but a few outliers show exceptionally high rates.

# Life Expectancy Distribution

- The life expectancy histogram shows that most countries have life expectancies around 70-80 years.
- This indicates improvements in healthcare globally.
